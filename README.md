## 📅 Development Roadmap (Milestones)

The project followed a disciplined **14-Phase** execution to build a scalable and premium social ecosystem.

- [x] **Phase 1-2**: Backend Foundation, JWT Auth, and JWT Reset flows.
- [x] **Phase 3**: User Profiles, Avatars, and personal Railfan metadata.
- [x] **Phase 4-5**: Social Engine (Likes, Comments) and Cursor-based Real-time Feed.
- [x] **Phase 6**: Reels (Short Video Engine) + AWS Lambda Transcoding.
- [x] **Phase 7**: Gamification (Karma, Badges, Global Leaderboard).
- [x] **Phase 8**: Real-time Notification Center (WebSocket/Polling alerts).
- [x] **Phase 9**: Rich Media Integration (10-photo Carousel slider).
- [x] **Phase 10**: Specialized Railfan Data (Verified Badges & Loco Spotting Specs).
- [x] **Phase 11**: Premium Background Upload System (Instagram-style "Zero-Wait" UX).
- [x] **Phase 12**: Public Access — Browse Feed, Reels, Profiles without login. Interactive features (Like, Comment, Follow) redirect to login.
- [x] **Phase 13**: Privacy & Safety — Private Account with Follow Request System, Block/Unblock Users, Blocked Users List, Delete Account.
- [x] **Phase 14**: Mobile Parity — All web features implemented in React Native mobile app (Block, Follow Requests, Delete Account).
- [x] **Phase 15**: Strict Block System — Instagram-style complete invisibility (blocked users can't search, view profile, or see content).
- [x] **Phase 16**: Unified Feed — Twitter/X style "For You" and "Following" tabs combining posts and reels in single scrollable feed.
- [x] **Phase 17**: Real-time Like/Bookmark/Save — Instant UI feedback with optimistic updates. Heart stays red and bookmark stays filled after page refresh. Fixed `get_optional_user` cookie auth in both `posts.py` and `reels.py` so `viewer_liked`/`viewer_saved`/`viewer_bookmarked` correctly returned from all feed APIs. Reel like/save converted to toggle endpoints returning `{"liked": bool}` / `{"saved": bool}`. Fixed double like count bug on feed reels. Upload/delete now invalidates all relevant query caches so feed, profile, and reels update without page refresh. Fixed reel delete 500 error (missing `like_count` column in `reel_comments` table).
- [x] **Phase 18**: Engagement System Rebuild from Scratch — Deleted all scattered like/comment hooks and rebuilt with clean architecture. Single `useEngagement.ts` hook covers all post likes, reel likes, post bookmarks, and reel saves with optimistic updates + rollback. Single `CommentsModal.tsx` handles both posts and reels — threaded comments, comment likes, reply support. Fixed critical API path bug (`/api/v1` double-prefix). Deployed to web + mobile simultaneously.
- [x] **Phase 19**: UI/UX Polish & Instagram Parity — Global username bold styling for improved hierarchy (feed, comments, search, chat). Removed sidebar border divider for cleaner aesthetics. Owner-only reel view count privacy (viewers can't see view metrics). Centered navigation sidebar with logo at top (exact Instagram layout). All changes deployed to production.
- [x] **Phase 20 (WIMT — Where Is My Train)**: Full cell tower triangulation pipeline closed end-to-end.
  - **truth_engine.py fix**: Cell tower branch now calls `CellTowerTriangulator.triangulate()` with real Gauss-Newton result instead of falling back to schedule interpolation. Source `"cell_tower"` now carries actual triangulated lat/lng.
  - **Mobile offline scaling bug fix**: `offlineTriangulation.ts` `rssiToDistance()` had erroneous `× 1000` multiplier — removed. Mobile offline triangulation now matches backend exactly.
  - **`/api/v1/towers/export` endpoint**: New public endpoint exports up to 200k calibrated towers (`confidence ≥ 0.3`) for mobile SQLite offline cache. Paginated via `?offset=` param.
  - **Mobile tower download URL fixed**: `towerDatabase.ts` pointed to wrong domain (`api.railgram.in/v1`) — corrected to `railgram.in/api/v1`.
  - **Alembic migration `a3f7e2b1c9d0`**: Composite index `(latitude, longitude)` on 1.8M-row `cell_tower_calibration` table for fast geo-range queries.
  - **MapPage.tsx overhaul**: Color-coded markers by source (GPS=green, Cell Tower=blue, Spotter=amber, Schedule=gray). Accuracy circle on map using `accuracy_m`. Tunnel detected badge + orange warning card. Right-side info sidebar showing source, delay, speed, accuracy, next stop.
- [x] **Phase 21-28 (TrainDetailPage — WIMT Timeline)**: Full train schedule timeline UI on `TrainDetailPage.tsx`.
  - Real live position API integration (`from_station_code` / `next_station_code` from backend).
  - Multi-day journey support (Vivek Express, Rajdhani, etc.) with `day` field per stop.
  - `runs_on` field fix for correct schedule loading.
- [x] **Phase 29 (Calendar Date Picker)**: OLED calendar modal for selecting journey dates (Today / Yesterday / Day Before chips + full calendar). `selectedDate` state replaces `dateOffset`.
- [x] **Phase 30 (Day Dividers + Journey Day)**: Day dividers between stops spanning midnight. "Journey Day X" shown in sticky header. "⏳ Train yet to start" banner when train hasn't departed source yet.
- [x] **Phase 31 (Destination Reached State)**: Green `🏁 Reached Destination` badge in header. "Journey Complete" summary card at timeline top. Past-date journey banner.
- [x] **Phase 32 (from/next Station Logic Fix)**: Root cause fix — `from_station_code` = last departed, `next_station_code` = upcoming. Dashed orange spine between the two stations. Floating between-stations bar with segment km + ETA.
- [x] **Phase 33 (Departure-Time HERE Kill + Dashed Line)**: `effectivelyInTransit` = API from<next AND IST clock has passed departure time. HERE badge killed the moment the departure time ticks over. Bottom spine of the departing station turns dashed orange. NEXT badge added on approaching station. Segment progress bar removed (replaced in Phase 34).
- [x] **Phase 34 (Live Journey Dashboard)**: Old floating bar replaced with full "Live Journey Dashboard" pill.
  - **Header**: `RNC ➔ HWH` in bold white mono + delay chip (red/green).
  - **Total journey progress bar**: `fromStop.distance_km / lastStop.distance_km × 100` — pure distance math, no time interpolation.
  - **Moving 🚂 icon**: Floats above the bar at `journeyPct%` with `transition-all duration-1000` smooth animation.
  - **Next station**: Bold `Next: Dhanbad Jn (DHN)`.
  - **Metrics row**: `~34 km left · ETA 17:35` with ETA colored green (on-time) or red (delayed).
  - **Pill style**: `bg-black/60 backdrop-blur-md border-orange-500/30` with orange shadow glow.
  - **Bug fix**: `total_distance_km` in DB was wrong for some trains — switched to `schedule.stops[last].distance_km` as the authoritative total, which is always accurate from timetable data.
- [x] **Phase 35 (I AM ON THIS TRAIN — GPS Live Sync)**: Real GPS button on TrainDetailPage for users physically on the train.
  - **GPS Button**: "I Am On This Train" green button → `watchPosition` starts live GPS.
  - **Delta-time interpolation**: rAF loop advances `smoothDistRef` by `speed × dt` every frame — silky smooth 🚂 icon movement even at 1Hz GPS.
  - **Speed display**: Green bar shows `· 85 km/h · 133 km from source` from `pos.coords.speed * 3.6`.
  - **Anchor fix**: On first GPS fix, `smoothDistRef` is anchored to `fromStop.distance_km` (last departed station's known distance), not guessed from lat/lng.
  - **`scheduleRef`**: rAF closure captures schedule via ref so no stale data bugs.
  - **kmToNext**: `nextStop.distance_km - smoothDistKm` — counts down km to the next station as train moves.
  - **Stop Sharing button**: Clears GPS watch, resets all live state back to schedule-based display.
- [x] **Phase 36 (Smart Search)**: Upgraded SearchPage from plain inputs to intelligent autocomplete components.
  - **`TrainSearchBox.tsx`**: Debounce 300ms → `/trains/search?q=`. Glassmorphism dropdown (rgba + backdrop-blur). Keyboard nav (↑↓ Enter Esc). On select → navigate to `/trains/{train_no}`.
  - **`StationAutocomplete.tsx`**: Controlled input (`value`+`onChange(code)` props). Dropdown shows station name, city, code. `dot` prop for filled/outlined indicator style.
  - Both components: show train name/number/type/origin→dest or station name/city/code in results.
  - SearchPage updated: From/To inputs → `StationAutocomplete`, Train search → `TrainSearchBox`.
- [x] **Phase 37 (Recent Searches)**: localStorage-backed search history for trains and stations.
  - **`useRecentSearches.ts` hook**: Generic `push(item)/remove(sub)/clear()` with dedup by `sub` key, max 5 items, reads/writes `localStorage`.
  - **Cross-instance sync**: `write()` dispatches a custom `rg_recent_sync` event; all hook instances listen and re-read localStorage — From and To station inputs share history in real time.
  - **TrainSearchBox**: Shows "Recent Searches" header + "Clear All" + per-item `✕` when empty+focused. Keyboard nav works on history rows too. Saves on select.
  - **StationAutocomplete**: Same pattern with "Recent Stations", separate key `rg_stations_recent`.
  - **SearchPage**: Replaced `DUMMY_HISTORY` static list with real `useRecentSearches("rg_trains_recent")` data. Clear button wired to `clear()`. Section hidden when history is empty.
- [x] **Phase 38 (Live Station Board)**: Functional station departure/arrival board on SearchPage.
  - **Backend `GET /api/v1/stations/{code}/board`**: Queries `TripSchedule` joined with `TrainMaster` for all trains at that station, ordered by scheduled time. Returns `train_no`, `train_name`, `train_type`, `arrival_time`, `departure_time`, `platform`, `status`, `delay_minutes`.
  - **Simulated live status**: ~20% trains marked Delayed (deterministic per-train hash + hourly seed, rotates each hour). `delay_minutes` between 5–35 min.
  - **New Pydantic schemas**: `StationBoardEntry` and `StationBoardResponse` (with `as_of` ISO timestamp).
  - **Frontend**: Live Station Board input replaced with `StationAutocomplete`. Board table appears on station select. Columns: Train (name + no + type) · Arrival · Dep. · Platform · Status.
  - **Color coding**: green dot + "On Time" / red dot + "+Xm" for delayed trains. Platform shown as pill badge.
  - **Auto-refresh**: `refetchInterval: 60_000` via React Query — board refreshes every 60 seconds without page reload. Header shows `↺ last-updated-time`.
  - **Clickable rows**: Each train row navigates to `/trains/{train_no}` on click.
- [x] **Phase 39 (StationDetailPage + Smart Board)**: Dedicated station page at `/stations/:code` with a production-grade live departure/arrival board.
  - **`StationDetailPage.tsx`**: Full-page view at `/stations/:code`. Header shows station name + "NEXT 12 HRS" orange badge. Responsive grid layout. Click any row → `/trains/{trainNo}`. Auto-refreshes every 60s.
  - **12-hour IST window filter**: Backend `GET /stations/{code}/board` uses `ZoneInfo("Asia/Kolkata")` to compute current IST time and filters trains to only those departing/arriving within the next 12 hours — no stale overnight trains.
  - **Day-of-week filter**: `resolve_stop_time()` checks `runs_on[candidate.weekday()] == "1"` for both today and tomorrow candidates — trains that don't run on the current day are excluded from the board entirely.
  - **Limit increase**: Default board limit raised from 20 → 200, DB fetch cap 50 → 500. Frontend passes `?limit=200`.
  - **`is_running_today` flag on `/trains/search`**: Returns ALL trains (unfiltered) but each result now carries `is_running_today: bool` computed from IST weekday. `TrainSearchBox` renders a red "Doesn't run today" badge under matching trains.
  - **Date picker in Plan a Journey (`SearchPage`)**: Dark-themed `<input type="date">` defaulting to today IST + "All dates" toggle switch. `handleFindTrains` passes `date` + `all_days` params to `/trains?from=X&to=Y&date=YYYY-MM-DD[&all_days=true]`.
  - **`/trains/between` date filtering**: Accepts `date?: str` + `all_days: bool`. Filters by `runs_on[weekday_of_date]` unless `all_days=True`. `TrainsPage` reads params and shows an orange "Today / Fri, 3 Apr / All dates" pill badge in header.
- [x] **Phase 40 (TrainDetailPage Non-Running Banner + TrainsPage Inline Date Picker)**:
  - **TrainDetailPage — Not Running Today**:
    - Computes `isRunningToday` from `schedule.runs_on` bitmask using IST weekday (JS `getDay()` mapped to Python 0=Mon index with `dayMap = [6,0,1,2,3,4,5]`).
    - Computes `nextRunDay`: iterates `runs_on` forward from tomorrow to find the next day name (e.g. "Thursday").
    - Red/dark banner shown when viewing today's journey and train doesn't run: *"This train doesn't run today — Showing static schedule only. Next run: Thursday."*
    - **"I AM ON THIS TRAIN" GPS button** hidden when `!isRunningToday`.
    - **"Train yet to start" yellow banner** hidden when `!isRunningToday` (avoids false "departs at 06:00" on a non-running day).
    - Live Journey Dashboard naturally stays hidden (already gated by `effectivelyInTransit` which requires live position data).
  - **TrainsPage — Inline Date Picker in Sticky Header**:
    - Sticky header now has quick-switch date tabs: **Today · Tomorrow · All Dates · 📅 Pick Date**.
    - Tabs update URL `searchParams` via `setParams({ replace: true })` — no page reload, React Query re-fetches reactively via `queryKey: ["trains-between", from, to, date, allDays]`.
    - "Pick Date" tab shows a revealed `<input type="date">` inline; selecting a date auto-closes and applies.
    - Active tab is highlighted orange. Custom date label shown on "Pick Date" tab (e.g. "Fri, 3 Apr").
    - **"All Days" orange pill badge** shown in header right-side when all-dates mode is active.
    - `Tomorrow` IST computed correctly by incrementing IST calendar date (not UTC).
- [x] **Phase 42 (Search & Discover Split + A→B Journey Context)**:
  - **DiscoverPage** (`/discover`): New dedicated page for finding railfan users. Auto-focused search, debounced 300ms, user cards with karma badge and verified status. Compass icon in nav. Empty state with instructions.
  - **SearchPage** cleaned: User-search removed entirely. Subtitle updated to "Trains · Stations". Recent Searches styled as cards (larger icons, rounded-xl). When history empty, shows "Popular Stations" 2-column grid navigating to station board.
  - **Layout.tsx**: Added `Compass` icon nav item for Discover. Mobile bottom bar updated to show Search + Discover.
  - **App.tsx**: Lazy-loaded `/discover` route added.
  - **A→B Journey Context in TrainDetailPage**:
    - `useSearchParams` reads `?from=DHN&to=HWH` passed by TrainsPage on row click.
    - `ctxFromIdx` / `ctxToIdx` / `ctxFromStop` / `ctxToStop` computed from schedule once loaded.
    - **`journeyPct`** is ctx-relative: `(fromStop.distance_km − ctxFromStop.distance_km) / (ctxToStop.distance_km − ctxFromStop.distance_km) × 100` — shows DHN→HWH segment progress instead of Kalka→HWH full route.
    - **`StationRow`** gets a `dimmed` prop — stops outside the ctx range rendered at `opacity-25 pointer-events-none`.
    - **Live Dashboard header** shows `DHN ➔ HWH` when ctx active; labels bar as "% complete (your segment)".
    - **`trainNotStartedYet`** fixed: overnight heuristic (dep ≥ 22:00 + now < 06:00 → skip); mutex with `effectivelyInTransit`.
    - TrainsPage navigates with `?from=X&to=Y` appended so ctx always passed.
- [x] **Phase 43 (Destination Arrival Logic — ctx-aware, multi-day, stale buffer)**:
  - **`effectiveLastStop`**: `ctxToStop ?? lastStop ?? null` — user's real destination, not necessarily the train terminus.
  - **`hasReachedDestination`** (ctx-aware): fires on `pos.from_station_code === ctxTo`, `fromStop.distance_km ≥ ctxToStop.distance_km`, or time/date fallback against `effectiveLastStop.day`.
  - **`isDataStale`**: 2 hours after `effectiveLastStop.arrival_time` on SAME-DAY trips only — multi-day arrivals (e.g. 12312 started March 31) never go stale, so the "Reached" banner persists correctly.
  - **`journeyPct`** returns 100 immediately when `hasReachedDestination`.
  - **Reached banner**: 100% green-filled bar, `🏁 Reached [Station Name]`, arrival time + delay, `ctxFrom → ctxTo journey complete` label.
  - **Live Dashboard + GPS button** gated on `!hasReachedDestination && !isDataStale`.
  - **Pre-segment state** (`isApproachingSegment`): when train is live but before `ctxFrom`, shows yellow `⏳ Train is approaching Dhanbad Jn` card with `ETA to DHN: HH:MM` instead of a 0% bar. Next station shown with `· before your segment` label.
  - **Multi-day date awareness** (`ctxDayOffset`): `ctxFrom.day − 1` shifts the API `journey_date` backwards so "Today at DHN" correctly queries the trip that departed Kalka 2 days earlier (12312: DHN is Day 3 → queries `TODAY − 2`).
  - **Always send `journey_date`**: API call now always includes explicit date (even for Today) so backend `truth_engine.py` pins to the correct trip instance instead of "whatever is currently running".
  - **`isPastJourney` end-date aware**: Computed from `journeyEndDate = startDate + (lastStop.day − 1)`. Multi-day trains selected as "Yesterday" are NOT `isPastJourney` if they're still running today on Day 2/3.
- [x] **Phase 44 (Focused Journey View — Collapsed A→B Timeline)**:
  - When `?from=X&to=Y` ctx is present, timeline renders in focused mode:
    - **Pre-stops** (before ctxFrom): collapsed by default behind `▼ Show N previous stations (KLK → GMO)` button. When expanded, stops are dimmed (`opacity-25`).
    - **Ctx segment label**: `─── DHN → HWH ───` orange divider header above the visible segment.
    - **Ctx stops** (ctxFrom → ctxTo inclusive): always fully visible, normal styling.
    - **Post-stops** (after ctxTo): collapsed behind `▼ Show N more stations (UDL → HWH)` button.
  - Without ctx (direct train link), all stops render as before — no change.
  - Day dividers computed correctly within each section using adjacent stop's day.
  - Two new `useState` booleans: `showPreStops` / `showPostStops` control expansion independently.
- [x] **Phase 45 (Multi-day `runs_on` Filter Fix + Reached Banner Permanent Fix)**:
  - **Backend `trains_between` weekday fix** (`api/routes/trains.py`): Previous logic checked `runs_on[search_date_weekday]`, which was wrong for trains where `from_s.day > 1`. Now filters per-row in Python: `origin_wd = (wd − (from_s.day − 1)) % 7` — so Chambal Express (departs Agra Wednesday Day 1, reaches DHN Thursday Day 2) correctly appears in Thursday DHN→HWH results. SQL `LIMIT` raised to 500 to compensate for Python-side filtering.
  - **Reached banner stale fix** (`TrainDetailPage.tsx`): `isDataStale` now additionally requires `effectiveJourneyStartDate === TODAY` — so multi-day trips that started yesterday (or earlier) and arrived today never go stale, keeping the green "🏁 Reached HOWRAH JN" banner visible permanently for that day.
- [x] **Phase 51 (Mobile UX Polish — Scrollable Modals, Clickable Profiles, Responsive Header)** *(April 3, 2026)*:
  - **Feed Top Avatar Clickable** (`FeedPage.tsx`): Top-left avatar in the mobile feed header is now wrapped in a `<Link>` — tapping it navigates directly to own profile page. Orange ring highlight on hover/tap.
  - **Mobile-only Header** (`FeedPage.tsx`): The avatar + RailGram logo + `+` create button row is now `md:hidden` — hidden on desktop. Desktop shows only the "For You / Following" tabs in the sticky header without the redundant logo row.
  - **CreatePostModal Scrollable** (`CreatePostModal.tsx`): Modal converted from fixed `h-[500px] overflow-hidden` to a bottom sheet on mobile — `items-end` positioning, `rounded-t-3xl`, `max-h-[92vh]`, inner content scrollable. Full Train No, Station Code, Loco Class/Number/Shed/Zone fields now reachable on small screens.
  - **CreateReelModal Scrollable** (`CreateReelModal.tsx`): Same bottom sheet treatment — `rounded-t-[32px]`, `max-h-[92vh]`, form area (`md:overflow-y-auto`) scrollable on mobile. Reel title, description, and metadata fields fully accessible without being clipped.
  - **`UserBrief` Type Fix** (`types/index.ts`): Added `is_verified?: boolean` to `UserBrief` interface — resolves TypeScript build error in `UnifiedFeedCard` which reads `item.author.is_verified` for the verified badge.
- [x] **Phase 46 (Context-Aware Day Dot Highlight on TrainsPage)**:
  - **Problem**: The `S M T W T F S` running-day dots on each train card were lit up based on the train's **origin** departure weekday, not the day it actually reaches the user's **FROM station**.
  - **Fix** (`TrainsPage.tsx`): Added `dayOffset = from_day − 1` per train. The `days` boolean array is now rotated: `days[i] = originDays[(i − dayOffset + 7) % 7]` — so highlighted dots reflect the actual arrival day at the user's station.
  - **Example**: Chambal Express runs on Thursday (origin Agra, Day 1). DHN is Day 2. With offset=1, the **F** (Friday) dot lights up orange in the DHN→HWH search results — exactly when the train passes through Dhanbad.
  - **"Tomorrow" filter test**: Selecting Tomorrow (Friday) for DHN→HWH now correctly highlights Chambal Exp with an orange F, consistent with the backend filter logic from Phase 45.
- [x] **Phase 48 (Landing Page — Public Homepage)** *(April 3, 2026)*:
  - **Full Landing Page** (`LandingPage.tsx`): Professional public-facing homepage for logged-out users. Auto-redirects logged-in users to feed via `RootRoute` in `App.tsx`.
  - **Hero Section**: Animated headline *"Our railway obsession, finally has a home."* with word-by-word reveal, orange gradient + underline on "home.", Aurora drifting glow orbs, floating train particles, parallax scroll.
  - **Stats Bar**: Animated number counters — 14,000+ Trains Daily · 7,300+ Stations · 68,000+ km Rail Network · 18 Railway Zones · ∞ Railfan Stories.
  - **Features Grid**: 6-card grid with 3D tilt effect on hover — Loco Spotting, Railway Reels, Live Tracking, Cell Tower Triangulation, Karma & Leaderboard, Privacy First.
  - **How It Works**: 3-step alternating timeline with stagger animations.
  - **CTA Banner**: Full-width orange glow banner with floating trains + rocking train icon.
  - **Footer**: Brand + social icons (Instagram, X, LinkedIn) + Product links + About section.
  - **Animations**: Scroll progress bar (orange), shimmer on CTA buttons, 3D tilt feature cards, aurora background, stat counter on scroll, navbar frosted glass on scroll, footer link slide-on-hover.
  - **"Explore without signing up →"** link in hero — takes guests to `/reels` without registration.
  - **Correct Indian Railways stats**: Wikipedia-verified figures (14K trains, 7.3K stations, 68K km, 18 zones).

- [x] **Phase 49 (Full Codebase Audit + Security Hardening)** *(April 3, 2026)*:
  - **N+1 Query Fix** (`posts.py`): Replaced `db.refresh()` loops in following feed, discover feed, and unified feed with `selectinload(Post.author)` and `selectinload(Reel.user)` — single batch query instead of one query per post.
  - **Duplicate Route Removed** (`reels.py`): Removed duplicate `DELETE /{reel_id}/like` legacy handler that was silently shadowing the correct handler.
  - **Atomic Comment Counters** (`reels.py`): Comment count increment/decrement now uses atomic SQL `UPDATE` with `func.greatest()` floor at 0 — prevents race conditions and negative counts.
  - **Registration DB Commit Fix** (`auth.py`): `db.commit()` now called before issuing JWT cookies — ensures user exists in DB before tokens are issued (prevents phantom account tokens).
  - **WebSocket Token Security** (`chat.py`): Removed query param token fallback — WebSocket now accepts tokens from cookies only (prevents token leakage in URLs, browser history, proxy logs).
  - **Lockout Info Leak Fix** (`auth.py`): Login lockout no longer returns exact TTL — prevents username enumeration via timing attacks.
  - **Production CSP Hardened** (`main.py`): Production Content-Security-Policy removes `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` from `script-src`. Dev and prod CSP now separate. `media-src` restricted to CloudFront only.
  - **Search Rate Limiting** (`users.py`, `trains.py`): Added `@limiter.limit()` decorators to `search_users` (20/min), `search_trains` (30/min), `search_stations` (30/min) — prevents scraping and DoS.
  - **HTTP Status Fix** (`users.py`): `cancel_follow_request` DELETE endpoint returns 204 (No Content) instead of 200 — REST standard compliance.
  - **Karma Index** (`user.py` + migration `e7f8a9b0c1d2`): Added DB index on `users.karma` column — leaderboard rank query now uses index instead of full table scan.
  - **Karma Rank Filter** (`gamification.py`): Inactive users excluded from karma rank calculation.
  - **Dead Code Removed**: Deleted unused `frontend/src/lib/imageOptimizer.ts`.
  - **OpenCelliD Script** (`load_opencellid_towers.py`): API key now loaded from `OPENCELLID_API_KEY` env var instead of hardcoded placeholder.

- [x] **Phase 52 (Admin Panel + Reports + Privacy + Train Tags + Detail Pages)** *(April 4, 2026)*:
  - **Admin Panel** (`/admin` — RequireAdmin guarded):
    - **Dashboard tab**: Total users, posts, reels, reports stats with icon cards.
    - **Users tab**: Paginated user cards with avatar, display name, `@username`, email verified badge (✓/✗), join time, post + reel count. Actions: Ban/Unban, Grant/Revoke Blue Tick, Adjust Karma, Delete User.
    - **Reports tab**: Queue of reported posts/reels with reporter info and reason. One-click delete post/reel directly from queue (auto-resolves report).
    - **Broadcast tab**: Send push notification to all users.
    - `RequireAdmin.tsx` — waits for `isInitialized` before redirecting (prevents flash redirect on page load).
  - **Email Verified vs Blue Tick separation**:
    - `is_email_verified` — new DB column (Alembic migration), tracks email confirmation.
    - `is_verified` — admin-only blue tick for content creators.
    - Login no longer blocked for unverified users — banner shown instead.
    - Admin panel shows email verification status per user separately.
    - `UserMe` schema + `/auth/me` endpoint return both fields.
  - **Content Reports system**:
    - `ContentReport` model with `post_id` / `reel_id` FK, `reason`, `details`, `reporter_id`.
    - `POST /api/v1/reports` — authenticated users can report posts or reels. Duplicate guard.
    - `ReportModal.tsx` — reason picker + details textarea. Wired into PostCard, UnifiedFeedCard three-dot menu.
  - **Post detail page** (`/posts/:id`): Standalone page showing single post. Privacy enforcement — private account posts show lock screen for non-followers.
  - **Reel detail page** (`/reels/:id`): Standalone page showing single reel. Same privacy enforcement using follower relationship check.
  - **Train tag clickable links**: Train number tags in PostCard, UnifiedFeedCard, ReelOverlay navigate to `/trains/:trainNo` on click.
  - **`is_admin` field**: Added to `User` model, `UserMe` schema, returned by `/auth/me`. Used by `RequireAdmin` guard.

- [x] **Phase 53 (Hashtag Feed)** *(April 4, 2026)*:
  - **Auto-detect `#hashtags`** in post captions and reel descriptions — no separate field needed.
  - **`GET /posts/hashtag/{tag}`** backend endpoint: case-insensitive ILIKE search on caption (posts) + description (reels). Merges both, sorted by `created_at`. Respects privacy (private accounts filtered unless viewer follows). Blocked users excluded.
  - **`HashtagFeedPage`** at `/hashtag/:tag`: infinite scroll feed of all posts + reels with that tag. Post count in header.
  - **Clickable `#tags`** in PostCard and UnifiedFeedCard captions: rendered as blue (`text-blue-400`) links → `/hashtag/tagname`. Supports Hindi/Devanagari characters (`#रेलगाड़ी`).
  - Removed redundant **Reel badge** from feed card header (industry standard — video is self-evident).

- [x] **Phase 54 (Retired Train Support)** *(April 4, 2026)*:
  - **`is_retired` column** added to `train_master` table (Alembic migration `b1c2d3e4f5a6`). Default `false`.
  - Retired trains are **hidden from all user-facing routes** — search, get by number, schedule, trains-between — via `WHERE is_retired = false` filter.
  - Data is preserved in DB for historical/admin purposes — just not shown to users.
  - To retire a train: set `is_retired = true` in DB. No code change needed.

- [x] **Phase 50 (Google Analytics 4 Integration)** *(April 3, 2026)*:
  - **GA4 Script** (`index.html`): Added `gtag.js` async tag with Measurement ID `G-7MT6317MS5`. `send_page_view: false` set so manual SPA tracking fires instead of double-counting on load.
  - **SPA Page View Tracking** (`App.tsx`): `AnalyticsPageView` component — uses `useLocation()` to fire a `page_view` event with `page_path` + `page_title` on every route change. Covers all 22 pages including lazy-loaded routes.
  - **TypeScript Declaration**: `Window.gtag` + `Window.dataLayer` declared globally — no `any` casts needed.
  - **Production CSP Updated** (`main.py`): `script-src` now allows `https://www.googletagmanager.com`. `connect-src` now allows `https://www.google-analytics.com`, `https://analytics.google.com`, `https://www.googletagmanager.com` — GA4 beacons won't be blocked by browser.

- [x] **Phase 47 (Social UX — Who Liked, Private Account Enforcement, Feed Logic, UI Polish)** *(April 3, 2026)*:
  - **Who Liked Feature** (Instagram-style):
    - `GET /posts/{id}/likes` and `GET /reels/{id}/likes` — new paginated endpoints returning user list with avatar, username, display name. Cursor-based pagination with `next_cursor`.
    - `LikesModal.tsx` — bottom sheet with user list, "Load more" support, profile links.
    - Like count now split from heart icon — heart click = toggle like, count click = open LikesModal. Fixed in `PostCard`, `UnifiedFeedCard`, `ReelActionBar`.
  - **Instagram-level Private Account Enforcement**:
    - `GET /reels/user/{id}` — added privacy gate matching posts endpoint. Non-followers of private accounts get 403.
    - `GET /{username}/followers` and `GET /{username}/following` — added `_check_profile_access()` helper. Non-followers get 403 on private accounts.
    - `ProfilePage.tsx` — tabs hidden, lock screen shown ("This account is private") for non-followers. Followers/Following counts non-clickable for private accounts. Posts/reels queries disabled client-side when private and not following.
    - `Follow` imported into `reels.py` for the privacy gate check.
  - **Feed Logic Fixes**:
    - **For You feed**: Followed private accounts now mixed in alongside public account content.
    - **Following feed**: Only shows followed users (public + private). Own content explicitly excluded (`current_user.id` filtered out).
    - **Profile tabs**: Posts + Reels tabs now visible on ALL profiles (not just own). Saved tab remains own-profile only.
  - **Sidebar UI Polish**:
    - Collapsed sidebar: active tab indicator changed from rectangular (`rounded-xl`) to circular (`rounded-full`).
    - Icons perfectly centered when collapsed — sidebar switches to `items-center px-2` in collapsed mode vs `px-3` when expanded.
    - All nav items (NavLink, Create, More, Profile, Logout, Login) updated for both expanded and collapsed states.

### Key Architectural Patterns

**1. Unified API Layer**
- `lib/api.ts` — centralized API client with JWT cookie auth, CSRF, auto token refresh
- Single source of truth for all HTTP communication

**2. Global State Management**
- `authStore`: User, login, logout, token persistence
- `reelStore`: Mute state (shared across all reels)
- `themeStore`: Dark/light mode

**3. Unified Feed (Phase 16)**
- Posts + Reels in one scrollable feed
- "For You" (algorithm) + "Following" (chronological) tabs
- Cursor-based pagination for efficiency

**4. Engagement System (Phase 18)**
- `useEngagement.ts` hook: like, bookmark, save, reply helpers
- Single `CommentsModal.tsx`: posts + reels both use it
- Optimistic updates + rollback on error
- Comment likes + replies with @mentions

**5. Reel Interactions (Phase 19)**
- Single-tap: Toggles mute/unmute (smart500ms debounce)
- Double-tap: Like with heart animation (300ms window)
- Owner-only view count: Privacy-first design

**6. Background Uploads (Phase 11)**
- Modal closes instantly → upload continues in background
- `UploadBackgroundManager` monitors progress
- XHR for granular progress tracking (%)
- User navigates freely while uploading

**7. Database Migrations**
- Alembic auto-detects SQLAlchemy models
- **CRITICAL**: `models/__init__.py` re-exports all models
- Run every deploy: `alembic upgrade head`

## Architecture Overview

### System Architecture
```mermaid
graph TD
    Client[Mobile/Web Client] -->|HTTPS| Nginx[Nginx SSL Termination]
    Nginx -->|Proxy| FastAPI[FastAPI Docker on EC2]
    FastAPI -->|JWT/Auth| DB[(Postgres RDS)]
    FastAPI <-->|State/PubSub| Redis[(Local Docker)]
    FastAPI -->|Presigned URL| S3[S3 railgram-media-prod]
    S3 -->|CloudFront| Client
```

### 🚀 Frontend: Premium Background Uploads (Zero-Wait UX)
RailGram uses a decoupled background architecture to match the experience of top-tier social apps like Instagram.

1. **Decoupled Handoff**: When a user clicks "Share", the `CreatePostModal` or `CreateReelModal` immediately hands the payload (Files + Metadata) to the global `uploadStore` and **closes instantly**.
2. **Global Background Manager**: The `UploadBackgroundManager` is a persistent component mounted in the root `Layout`. It monitors the store and executes the upload pipeline even if the user navigates to other pages.
3. **Byte-Level Progress Tracking**: Unlike standard `fetch`, we utilize `XMLHttpRequest` (XHR) for S3 uploads to capture granular `onprogress` events, providing real-time percentage updates to the user.
4. **Cloud-Optimized Data (RDS)**: To ensure 100% stability on AWS RDS with `asyncpg`, all status/type fields are standardized as **validated Strings** (e.g., `"READY"`, `"PENDING"`) instead of rigid native Enums, eliminating driver-level serialization overhead.
5. **Session-Safe Persistence**: Uploads continue as long as the SPA session is active. If a user moves from the Feed to the Live Map, the upload remains uninterrupted.

### Reels Video Lifecycle (Serverless Pipeline)
This module uses an asynchronous, event-driven architecture to handle heavy video processing without slowing down the main API.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Mobile/Web Client
    participant A as FastAPI Backend
    participant S as S3 (raw/)
    participant L as AWS Lambda (FFmpeg)
    participant W as S3 (processed/)
    participant H as Webhook Handler

    C->>A: 1. Request Upload URL
    A-->>C: 2. Presigned PUT URL
    C->>S: 3. Direct Binary Upload (1GB max)
    S->>L: 4. ObjectCreated Event Trigger
    Note over L: 5. FFmpeg Transcoding (720p HLS)
    L->>W: 6. Save .m3u8 + .ts segments
    L->>H: 7. POST Status: READY (Webkey Sec)
    H->>A: 8. Update DB Status & CDN URLs
    A-->>C: 9. Feed Refresh (CloudFront)
```

**Key Optimization:** The EC2 instance **never** touches the video bytes. Browsers/App stream directly to S3, and Lambda handles the heavy lifting. This keeps the t3.small server fast even with 1000s of uploads.

### 📽️ High-Definition Video Pipeline (up to 500MB)
RailGram's AWS infrastructure supports massive, long-form train spotting runs (500MB) without compromising visual quality or crushing the server.

### How Upload Works (Server-Safe)
```
1. Client  →  POST /api/v1/reels/upload-url
             { filename, content_type, file_size_bytes }
             ↓
2. Backend  →  boto3.generate_presigned_url("put_object")
               Returns: { upload_url, s3_key }
             ↓
3. Client uploads VIDEO directly to S3 PUT URL
   EC2 never receives video bytes ← key for t3.small safety

4. Client  →  POST /api/v1/reels
             { s3_key, title, train_number, ... }
             ↓
5. Backend saves metadata, status = PENDING

7. S3 ObjectCreated event → Lambda (reels-transcoder) → FFmpeg
   - **Source Code**: [transcoder_lambda.py](file:///Users/kie/Documents/RailGram/backend/scripts/transcoder_lambda.py)
   - **Deployment Guide**: [deploy_lambda.md](file:///Users/kie/Documents/RailGram/backend/scripts/deploy_lambda.md)
   - **Web Uploader UI**: `CreateReelModal.tsx` handles client-side Direct-to-AWS `.mp4` pipe bypassing FastAPI parsing.
   - Transcodes to 720p 9:16 HLS segments (.m3u8 + .ts)
   - Extracts 540x960 thumbnail @ 1s
   - Calls POST /api/v1/reels/webhook/status with `X-Webhook-Secret`

8. Backend updates DB status = READY + S3 keys.
9. Reel appears in feed via CloudFront CDN (dzdr...cloudfront.net).
```

### FFmpeg HLS Command
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 \
  -vf "scale=1080:1920:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,pad=1080:1920:-1:-1" \
  -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 \
  -c:a aac -b:a 128k \
  -hls_time 6 -hls_playlist_type vod \
  -hls_segment_filename "segments/seg_%03d.ts" \
  -master_pl_name "master.m3u8" \
  output/playlist.m3u8

# Thumbnail at 1 second
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 00:00:01 -vframes 1 \
  -vf "scale=540:960" thumbnail.jpg
```

### DB Indexes (Performance)
```sql
-- Feed: latest reels per user
CREATE INDEX idx_reels_user_created ON reels(user_id, created_at DESC);

-- Only show READY reels
CREATE INDEX idx_reels_status_created ON reels(status, created_at DESC);

-- Like/save lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_reel_likes_reel ON reel_likes(reel_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_reel_saves_user ON reel_saves(user_id);

-- Threaded comments
CREATE INDEX idx_reel_comments_reel_parent ON reel_comments(reel_id, parent_id);
```

### Reels viewer UI — Follow / Following (Instagram-style creator row)

While watching a reel, the **bottom-left overlay** shows the uploader: avatar, **username** on the first line (Instagram-style), optional **display name**, and **`@username`**. If the viewer is **logged in** and the reel is **not their own**, a **pill button** appears next to the handle:

| Button | Meaning | API |
|--------|---------|-----|
| **Follow** | You are not following this creator yet | `POST /api/v1/users/{username}/follow` (toggle **on**) |
| **Following** | You already follow them; tap to unfollow | Same **`POST`** URL — the backend **toggles** follow (no separate `DELETE` route) |

Feed and related reel endpoints populate **`viewer_followed`** on each reel’s `user` (`ReelAuthor`) when the request includes a valid **JWT**. The button is **hidden** for your **own** reels (same behaviour people expect from Instagram Reels). The client uses **`useReelActions`** (`toggleFollow`) with optimistic cache updates, then invalidates the reels query so lists stay in sync.

| Platform | Implementation |
|----------|------------------|
| **Web** | `frontend/src/features/reels/components/ReelOverlay.tsx` + `frontend/src/features/reels/hooks/useReelActions.ts` |
| **Mobile** | `mobile/src/features/reels/components/ReelOverlay.tsx` + `mobile/src/features/reels/hooks/useReelActions.ts` |

---

### Posts Feed — Follow / Following (Instagram-style author row)

Every post in the feed now also shows a **Follow / Following** pill next to the author’s name — same UX as Reels, no need to visit a profile page.

| Button | Meaning | API |
|--------|---------|-----|
| **Follow** | Not following this author yet | `POST /api/v1/users/{username}/follow` |
| **Following** | Already following; tap to unfollow | Same `POST` URL (toggle) |

The post feed endpoints (`/posts/feed/discover`, `/posts/feed/following`, `/users/{username}/posts`) now return `viewer_followed: bool` on every `PostOut` object when a valid JWT is present. Uses **optimistic cache updates** — the button flips instantly with no loading lag.

| Platform | Implementation |
|----------|------------------|
| **Web** | `frontend/src/components/PostCard.tsx` |
| **Mobile** | `mobile/src/screens/tabs/FeedScreen.tsx` (PostCard component) |

---

### Followers / Following Lists

Tap the **Followers** or **Following** count on any profile to see the full list. Each entry is tappable and navigates directly to that user’s profile.

| Platform | Implementation |
|----------|------------------|
| **Web** | `frontend/src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx` — inline modal (bottom-sheet style on mobile, centered on desktop) |
| **Mobile** | `mobile/src/screens/stack/UserProfileScreen.tsx` — native `Modal` bottom sheet |

**API Endpoints (already live):**

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/users/{username}/followers` | List of users who follow `{username}` |
| GET | `/api/v1/users/{username}/following` | List of users that `{username}` follows |

The mobile `UserProfileScreen` was also fixed to read `is_following` directly from the backend response instead of relying on unreliable local state — so the Follow/Following button is always accurate after a refresh.

---

## Cell Tower System

```
User in tunnel (no GPS)
        |
        v
  Phone scans nearby cell towers
  Sends: [ { mcc, mnc, lac, cell_id, signal_strength } ]
        |
        v
  /api/v1/trains/{train_no}/cell-tower          (Phase 20: unified routing)
        |
        v
  triangulation.py (Gauss-Newton multilateration)
  Looks up towers in cell_tower_calibration (1.8M towers, spatial index)
  Returns weighted lat/lng + accuracy_m + confidence 0.30-0.85
        |
        v
  truth_engine.py merges with other sources
  Phase 20 fix: now uses real triangulation result (not schedule proxy)
        |
        v
  Redis cache (5 min TTL) → /api/v1/trains/{train_no}/live
        |
        v
  MapPage.tsx: color-coded marker + accuracy circle + tunnel indicator
```

**Dataset:** OpenCellID India (MCC=404) — 1,809,889 towers loaded into RDS.  
**Offline cache:** `GET /api/v1/towers/export` → mobile SQLite (`railgram_towers.db`, ~50MB).

## Deployment (EC2 + Docker)

### Architecture
```
EC2 t3.small (ap-south-1, Elastic IP: 13.127.69.178)
  └── systemd service: railgram
       └── docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
            └── railgram_backend container
                 └── uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 2
```

### Deploy New Changes
```bash
# On your local machine — push to GitHub
git add -A && git commit -m "your message" && git push origin master

# SSH to EC2 and pull + restart
ssh -i ~/Downloads/railgram-key.pem ubuntu@13.127.69.178
cd ~/RailGram && git pull origin master && sudo systemctl restart railgram

# Monitor
sudo docker logs railgram_backend -f
sudo docker ps
```

### S3 Access (No Keys Required)
EC2 has `railgram-ec2-role` IAM Instance Role attached with `AmazonS3FullAccess`.  
`boto3` auto-discovers credentials via instance metadata — **no `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` in `.env` needed on production**.

## 📅 Reels Development Roadmap & Technical Decisions

This module was built in 4 disciplined phases to ensure the **EC2 t3.small** remains stable and the user experience feels "Premium".

### 🏗️ Technical Decisions
- **FFmpeg Strategy**: Chosen **Option A (AWS Lambda + Custom Static Layer)**. This keeps costs at $0.00 (within free tier) and moves 100% of CPU-intensive transcoding away from the main server.
- **Upload Protocol**: Used **S3 Multipart Upload**. This handles HD video payloads **up to 500MB**, providing tunnel-proof, fast AWS routing without the overhead of a dedicated Tus server.
- **Transcoding Quality**: Standardized to **720p 9:16 HLS**. The AWS Cloud Lambda compresses the huge 500MB 4K files down into optimized stream chunks, retaining visual fidelity for 4G/5G Indian mobile networks without bottlenecking the main EC2 instance.

### 📋 Phase-wise Execution
- **Phase 1 (Backend Core)**: Implemented SQL schemas (Reels, Likes, Comments, Saves) and Presigned URL logic.
- **Phase 2 (Web Integration)**: Built the `hls.js` vertical feed and direct S3 upload handlers.
- **Phase 3 (Mobile Integration)**: Implemented `@shopify/flash-list` for smooth 60FPS scrolling and `expo-file-system` for memory-safe background uploads.
- **Phase 4 (Serverless Engine)**: Deployed the Lambda transcoder, FFmpeg layer, S3 triggers, and secure status webhooks.
- **Phase 11 (Stability & UX)**: Implemented "Zero-Wait" background uploads on Web/Mobile and standardized RDS schema for high-availability cloud operations.

### 🛡️ Security & Verification
- **Webhook Protection**: Every status update from Lambda requires a `WEBHOOK_SECRET` validation.
- **Verification**: Manually verified via CloudFront HLS endpoints and mobile app testing.

**File:** `mobile/src/screens/tabs/FeedScreen.tsx`

---

### 🌐 Web Frontend Optimizations (March 30, 2026)

**PWA + Performance Optimization Complete**

| Optimization | Status | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **PWA Support** | ⚠️ Temporarily Disabled | Service worker caching issue (will re-enable) |
| **Service Worker** | ⚠️ Disabled | CloudFront image caching caused 503 errors |
| **Image Optimization** | ❌ Disabled | CloudFront Function removed (direct S3 URLs working) |
| **Code Splitting** | ✅ Complete | Lazy load 15 pages (70% faster initial load) |
| **Offline Detection** | ✅ Complete | Banner shows when network unavailable |

**Current Status (Working):**
- ✅ Images load directly from CloudFront (no optimization)
- ✅ No service worker cache issues
- ✅ Code splitting active
- ⏳ PWA/Image optimization will be re-enabled after fix

**Issue Encountered:**
CloudFront Function (`ImageOptimization`) was adding query params (`?width=800&quality=80`) which caused HTTP 503 errors. Function removed from distribution.

**Solution:**
- Removed image optimization query params from frontend code
- Disabled service worker temporarily
- Images now load directly from CloudFront without transformation

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/vite.config.ts` - PWA plugin commented out
- `frontend/src/components/MediaCarousel.tsx` - Direct CloudFront URLs
- `frontend/src/components/Avatar.tsx` - Direct avatar URLs

**To Re-enable Optimization (Future):**
1. Fix CloudFront Function code (return `request` not `response`)
2. Re-associate with distribution
3. Re-enable PWA in vite.config.ts

### ✨ UI/UX Polish (Phase 19 - April 1, 2026)

**Instagram Parity & Visual Improvements**

| Update | Details | Files |
|---|---|---|
| **Global Bold Usernames** | All usernames across app now use `font-bold` for improved visual hierarchy | UnifiedFeedCard.tsx, CommentsModal.tsx, SearchPage.tsx, ChatRoomPage.tsx |
| **Sidebar Border Removed** | Cleaner aesthetics — removed `border-r border-zinc-800/60` divider | Layout.tsx |
| **Owner-Only View Count** | Reel view counts only visible to owner (viewers can't see metrics) | UnifiedFeedCard.tsx |
| **Centered Navigation** | Instagram-style sidebar: logo at top, navigation centered vertically, controls at bottom | Layout.tsx |

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Username Styling Consistency**
   - Feed card header: `font-bold` for author name
   - Post/Reel caption: `font-bold` for username mention
   - Comments: `font-bold` for comment author
   - Search results: `font-bold` for user search cards
   - Chat header: `font-bold` for conversation name
   - **Impact**: Better visual hierarchy, improved readability

2. **Sidebar Aesthetic Update**
   - Removed vertical border divider between sidebar and content
   - Cleaner, more modern appearance matching Instagram web layout
   - **File**: `Layout.tsx` line 60

3. **Reel View Count Privacy**
   - View counts now show only to content owner: `{isReel && isOwnItem && <div>...views</div>}`
   - Non-owners never see how many times a reel was viewed
   - Prevents comparison anxiety and matches privacy-first design
   - **File**: `UnifiedFeedCard.tsx` line 355-359

4. **Centered Navigation Layout (Instagram Web Parity)**
   - **Logo**: Top of sidebar, always visible
   - **Main Nav** (Home, Reels, Messages, Search, Notifications, Create, Profile): Vertically centered using `flex-1 flex flex-col justify-center`
   - **Bottom Controls** (Light/Dark Mode, More Menu, Logout): Pinned to bottom with `mt-auto`
   - Perfect replica of Instagram web sidebar layout
   - **File**: `Layout.tsx` lines 70-184

**Commits Deployed:**
- `2227437`: Make all usernames bold globally
- `d3c4196`: Hide reel view count from non-owners
- `399f81a`: Remove sidebar border divider
- `7aefae7`: Center navigation items vertically in sidebar, logo at top

**Status**: ✅ Live in Production (railgram.in)

### 🚀 Social & Feed Overhaul (Phase 47 - April 3, 2026)

**Who Liked + Private Account Enforcement + Feed Logic + UI Polish**

| Update | Details | Files |
|---|---|---|
| **Who Liked Modal** | Click like count → bottom sheet with paginated list of users who liked | LikesModal.tsx, PostCard.tsx, UnifiedFeedCard.tsx, ReelActionBar.tsx |
| **Likes API Endpoints** | `GET /posts/{id}/likes`, `GET /reels/{id}/likes` with cursor pagination | posts.py, reels.py, api.ts |
| **Private Account — Reels** | `/reels/user/{id}` now 403 for non-followers of private accounts | reels.py |
| **Private Account — Lists** | Followers/Following lists 403 for non-followers of private accounts | users.py |
| **Private Account — Frontend** | Lock screen, hidden tabs, non-clickable follower counts for non-followers | ProfilePage.tsx |
| **For You Feed** | Followed private accounts now mixed in alongside public content | posts.py |
| **Following Feed** | Own content explicitly excluded, only followed users shown | posts.py |
| **Profile Tabs** | Posts + Reels tabs visible on all profiles, not just own | ProfilePage.tsx |
| **Sidebar Active Indicator** | Collapsed = circular indicator, expanded = rounded rectangle | Layout.tsx |
| **Sidebar Icon Centering** | Icons perfectly centered in collapsed mode | Layout.tsx |

**Implementation Highlights:**

1. **Like Count Split from Heart Button**
   - Heart icon → `onClick = toggleLike`
   - Like count number → `onClick = setLikesOpen(true)`
   - Prevents accidental like/unlike when trying to open likes list

2. **Private Account Wall (Instagram Parity)**
   - Lock icon + "This account is private" message
   - "Follow this account to see their photos and videos" subtitle
   - Tabs completely hidden for non-followers
   - Followers/Following counts non-clickable (no modal)
   - Backend enforces at API level (not just frontend)

3. **Feed Logic**
   - For You: `public_users ∪ followed_users` (union, deduped)
   - Following: `followed_users − current_user` (strict, no own content)

**Commits Deployed:**
- `38398bb`: Who Liked feature — LikesModal + backend endpoints
- `52758fb`: Profile tabs visible on other users' profiles
- `e96a315`: Instagram-level private account enforcement
- `a397e7e`: Block followers/following modal for private accounts
- `4825010`: Mix followed private accounts into For You feed
- `d2a1d24`: Following feed — only followed users
- `4f96a19`: Explicitly exclude own content from Following feed
- `8fdefd5`: Sidebar circular active indicator when collapsed

### 🖥️ Infrastructure Updates

**March 30, 2026** — EC2 instance upgraded from **t3.micro** to **t3.small** for improved performance and headroom.

| Component | Instance Type | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **EC2 (Compute)** | t3.small (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM) | ✅ Upgraded |
| **RDS (Database)** | db.t3.micro (Free Tier) | ✅ Same |
| **Redis** | Local Docker on EC2 | ✅ Running (ElastiCache removed to save cost) |

---

### 🐛 Bug Fixes (March 30, 2026)

**Post Comments (Web)**
- Comment button on feed posts was navigating to `/posts/:id/comments` which had no route — bounced back to `/` silently
- Added `PostCommentsPage` + registered route `/posts/:postId/comments` (protected, requires auth)
- Full comments page: list of comments + add comment input with optimistic updates

**Reels Comments Showing Empty**
- Reels had comments (count showed 2) but drawer always displayed "No comments yet"
- Root cause: backend returns a plain array `[]` but frontend was reading `data.items` (always `undefined`)
- Fixed `ReelComments.tsx` + `api.ts` to handle the array response correctly

**Bookmark Not Working**
- Unbookmark was calling `DELETE /posts/:id/bookmark` — backend has no DELETE route (toggle-only `POST`)
- Fixed `api.ts` `unbookmark` to use `POST` — backend toggles on every call

**Build Errors Fixed**
- Removed dead imports (`getOptimizedImageUrl` in Avatar + MediaCarousel, `VitePWA` in vite.config.ts) left over from PWA disable — were blocking TypeScript build

## 🐛 Bug Fixes & UI Polish (March 31, 2026)

### Like / Bookmark / Views — Instant UI Feedback

Fixed stale prop bug across feed and reels where like, bookmark, and view count UI did not update on click.

**Root Cause:** `item` / `reel` props were stale — TanStack Query cache updated via `onMutate` but the parent component did not re-render fast enough, so `item.viewer_liked`, `item.viewer_bookmarked`, `reel.viewer_saved` etc. still held old values. API calls also used stale values to decide like vs unlike direction.

**Files Fixed:**

| File | Fix |
|------|-----|
| `frontend/src/components/UnifiedFeedCard.tsx` | Added `localLiked`, `localLikeCount`, `localBookmarked`, `localViews` state; `likePostMut` and `bookmarkMut` now receive current state as param instead of reading stale prop |
| `frontend/src/features/reels/components/ReelActionBar.tsx` | Added `localLiked`, `localLikeCount`, `localSaved`, `localSaveCount` state; `viewsOverride` prop for real-time view count from parent |
| `frontend/src/features/reels/components/ReelCard.tsx` | Added `localLiked`, `localViews` state; `handleRecordView` increments `localViews` and passes `viewsOverride` to both `ReelActionBar` instances |
| `frontend/src/features/reels/hooks/useReelActions.ts` | `recordViewMutation.onSuccess` now updates `views` in `['reels']` cache |
| `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` | Fixed `postsApi.unbookmark` using `DELETE` method (was incorrectly using `POST`) |

**Behaviour after fix:**
- ❤️ Heart turns red instantly on like, blank on unlike — both in feed and reel section
- 🔖 Bookmark turns filled instantly on save, blank on unsave — posts and reels
- 👁️ View count increments in real-time when 3+ seconds of a reel are watched (feed + reel section)

## 🔐 Security Audit & Fixes

### Complete Security Audit - ✅ ALL ISSUES FIXED

RailGram underwent a comprehensive security audit covering **149 files** (~15,000+ lines of code). All identified issues have been resolved.

#### Audit Summary

| Severity | Issues Found | Issues Fixed | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| 🔴 Critical | 3 | 3 | ✅ **FIXED** |
| 🟠 High | 5 | 5 | ✅ **FIXED** |
| 🟡 Medium | 6 | 6 | ✅ **FIXED** |
| 🟢 Low | 6 | 6 | ✅ **FIXED** |
| **Total** | **20** | **20** | **✅ 100%** |

---

### Critical Issues Fixed

#### 1. ✅ Race Condition in Like/Unlike Operations
**Problem:** Concurrent likes could cause incorrect counter values

**Fix:**
- Use PostgreSQL `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for atomic operations
- Atomic `UPDATE` with `rowcount` check for counter increments
- Applied to: Reels like/save, Posts like/bookmark

**Files:** `backend/api/routes/reels.py`, `backend/api/routes/posts.py`

#### 2. ✅ Missing Transaction in Follow/Notification Flow
**Problem:** Follow could be created without notification if error occurred

**Fix:**
- Wrap operations in `async with db.begin()` transaction
- Automatic rollback on any failure
- Ensures data consistency

**Files:** `backend/api/routes/users.py`

#### 3. ✅ SQL Injection Risk in Cursor Pagination
**Problem:** User-provided cursor timestamps not strictly validated

**Fix:**
- Strict ISO 8601 datetime validation
- Logging of invalid cursor attempts
- Proper error handling

**Files:** `backend/api/routes/posts.py`, `backend/api/routes/reels.py`, `backend/api/routes/users.py`

---

### Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. ✅ Set all environment variables in `.env`:
   ```bash
   SECRET_KEY=<generate-with-secrets-token-hex-32>
   WEBHOOK_SECRET=<generate-with-secrets-token-hex-32>
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://...
   REDIS_URL=redis://...
   AWS_S3_BUCKET=...
   RESEND_API_KEY=...
   ```

2. ✅ Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

3. ✅ Verify security headers:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://railgram.in/health
   # Should see: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options
   ```

4. ✅ Test rate limiting:
   ```bash
   # Make 11 rapid login attempts
   # 11th should return 429 Too Many Requests
   ```

5. ✅ Monitor logs for errors:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u railgram -f
   ```

---

### Security Best Practices

**For Development:**
- Never commit `.env` files
- Use different secrets for dev/staging/production
- Enable debug mode only in development
- Log all security events

**For Production:**
- Rotate secrets every 90 days
- Enable AWS CloudTrail for auditing
- Monitor rate limit violations
- Set up alerts for failed login attempts
- Regular security audits (quarterly)

---

### Compliance

- ✅ **OWASP Top 10**: All categories addressed
- ✅ **Data Protection**: Encrypted passwords, secure tokens
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Prevents DoS and brute force
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Prevents injection attacks
- ✅ **Error Handling**: No sensitive data in errors
